# Musical gnere classification with KNN 
GTZAN Dataset was used. You can download from this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification.  
Kod folder includes features of songs, this features extracted with FFT and STFT.  
In code file you can see FFT fucntion, this function was written by me. It is too slow numpy fft function.  
You can use numpy.fft.fft() function if you want.  
Also, after you downloaded GTZAN Dataset, you should create Data folder and genres original folder inside of the Data folder.  
Dataset was downloaded as this file structure.  I didn't push Data folder because it is too large and I couldn't upload it.

Finally, you should move Kod folder then you can run code with this command.==> "python v2"
